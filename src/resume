Boid Simulation
	- Created to explore spatial sorting, cache-effeciency, and instruction optimization.
	- Simple and responsive. Boids and GUI render at v-sync while Boids update as fast as possible.
	- CPU simulation (GPU render)
		Ryzen 9 7950x (16c,32t) - Zen 4
		~2 Million at 100 updates/sec
		Ryzen 9 4900 (8c,16t) - Zen 2   
		~500 Thousand at 100 updates/sec
	- GPU simulation (GPU update and render)
		RX 7900XT - RDNA 3
		~200 Million at 100 updates/sec
		RTX 2060 - Turing
		~100 Million at 100 updates/sec
		Integrated Radeon - RDNA 2
		~ 50 Million at 100 updates/sec

Tree Simulation
	- Finite Element Method
	- Voxel Ray-Marching ***
	- 3-D Boids to simulate airflow.
	- Audio generation for leaves and wind.

Text Editor
	- Used to modify itself.
	- Capable of reading and visulizing compiler output (TCC, GCC, CLANG)
	- Simple and powerfull GUI
	- Environment for running and managing other projects.

Much of the boilerpoate code is shared between all three projects. 
The projects can be compiled seperatley, or all together, and be switched between at runtime.

Projects can compile for x86-64 on Linux or Windows, or WebAssembly.

Source code available by request only. Please contact me for specifics.
